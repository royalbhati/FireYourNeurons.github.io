## What is One Hot Encoding and when is it benificial?

If you are an Machine Learning or Deep Learning Enthusiast you have been reading or hearing this term _One Hot Encoding_ a lot.
So what exactly this thing is ?
If you work with sci-kit learn then they have this One-Hot Encoder module whose documentations says One-Hot Encoder

```
Encode categorical integer features using a one-hot aka one-of-K scheme.

The input to this transformer should be a matrix of integers, denoting the values taken on by categorical (discrete) features. The output will be a sparse matrix where each column corresponds to one possible value of one feature. It is assumed that input features take on values in the range [0, n_values).

This encoding is needed for feeding categorical data to many scikit-learn estimators, notably linear models and SVMs with the standard kernels.
